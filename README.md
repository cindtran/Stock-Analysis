# Stock-Analysis
<strong>Overview of Project</strong>

## <strong>Purpose:</strong>

To create a Microsoft Excel VBA code to collect data on stock information for 2017 and 2018. This code is to determine if there should be investments in stocks or not. This code is also used to determine if refactoring runs faster and more efficient.

### <strong>Results: Stock Analysis</strong>
 
  Comparing the data, althought there was more volume in 2018, there were less positive returns compared to 2017. This could determine that in 2017 the company was getting more return on investment. 2018 data showed us there were more risks than wins.

### <strong>Comparing Refactoring Code:</strong>

<strong>When comparing the original code and refactoring code:</strong>

<strong>Advantages:</strong>

The data below indicates that the refactoring code provide quicker results. 

The code was more managable and easier to read

<strong>Disadvantages:</strong>

Although the code was easier to read, there were debugging errors that cause additional time to solve

### Summary: How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

Overall, refactoring the code helps reduces the number of loops which then decreases the memory needed to process the code. It then provides the results within a faster time. Refactoring should be recommended to check the effiency of the code.
